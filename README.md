# Pokemon-dataset
The project aims to provide insights into the Pokemon world, their characteristics, and various trends within the dataset. Unlike traditional machine learning projects, this project focuses on descriptive analytics, data visualization, and storytelling.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various Pokemon, including their types, abilities, base stats, and evolution chains. It serves as a rich source of information for understanding the diverse Pokemon universe.

## Objectives
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct a thorough exploration of the Pokemon dataset to uncover interesting patterns, distributions, and relationships among different attributes.

2. **Data Visualization:** Utilize visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts to represent key characteristics of Pokemon, including type distributions, base stat comparisons, and evolution patterns.

3. **Storytelling:** Craft a narrative around the insights gained from the data, highlighting notable features, rare occurrences, or evolutionary trends within the Pokemon world.

4. **Interactive Dashboards (Optional):** Create interactive dashboards or visualizations using tools like Plotly or Bokeh to engage users in exploring the dataset.

## Files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the step-by-step exploration and visualization process.
- `data/`: Contains the Pokemon dataset used for analysis.
- `visualizations/`: Folder for storing static images or interactive visualizations generated during the project.

## Usage
Provide instructions on how to replicate the exploratory analysis and visualizations. Include details on the tools or libraries used, such as Jupyter notebooks, matplotlib, seaborn, or any other visualization libraries.
